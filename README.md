### Past Completed Projects
- Arras.io LB Bot, reverse engineered packet structure of Arras.io to fake being a client. Retreived all scoreboards of every server in an interval of 5 minutes, and formatted them into a pretty embed using Discord.js. Received help from [ABC](https://github.com/ABCxFF).
- Diep.io LB Bot, same nature as Arras.io LB Bot but much harder. Co-developed with [Bismuth](https://github.com/fractallized), help received from [ABC](https://github.com/ABCxFF), [Shadam](https://github.com/supahero1), and [diep7444](https://github.com/diepiodiscord).
- Arras.io Scraper, a dump of a week's worth of data collection from every Arras.io server. Only possible with [ABC](https://github.com/ABCxFF) and [Bird](https://github.com/lolbird). [Repo](https://github.com/ABCxFF/db).
- Schem bot, a bot made in Discord.js which automatically made sandbox party links upon requests by faking being a client. Received help from [Shadam](https://github.com/supahero1).
